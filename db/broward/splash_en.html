<h3><strong>The Agency</strong></h3>
<p>Residents in search of critical social services such as emergency financial assistance, food, shelter, housing, child care,  job training placement, relief from abuse, depression, summer/after school programs, healthcare or mental support often do not know where to begin. Many are confronted with a confusing array of organizations through which they must search for what they need. Looking for help means locating dozens of phone numbers and/or web sites (for those who have access), and then searching through a maze of agencies and services to make the right connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established as a 501(c)(3) in 1995, 2-1-1 Broward is the only 24/7 comprehensive agency in the county that provides individuals and families with all of the critical connections to health and human service agencies and programs they need in just one call.  Everyday, trained and degreed 2-1-1 counselors assist hundreds of individuals by providing support, information and referrals that will help them to access theright services. As a community-wide point of entry 2-1-1 is accessible and culturally appropriate. The general helpline is available 24/7, and hours of service for the specialty lines are convenient for all families. Services and materials are accessible to those with disabilities. In addition, services are delivered in the language most comfortable to the caller.  For languages not spoken on site, 2-1-1 staff uses Language Line, an interpreter service.</p>
